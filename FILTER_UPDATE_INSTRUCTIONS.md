# AI Content Filter Update Instructions

## Summary of Changes

The AI content filter has been significantly improved to reduce false positives in the news feed. The filter now uses a multi-stage approach:

1. **Exclusion Patterns**: First checks for patterns that indicate non-AI content (gaming, hardware reviews, legal issues, etc.)
2. **Primary AI Keywords**: Looks for strong AI indicators in titles and early descriptions
3. **Context Phrases**: Checks for phrases like "launches AI", "unveils AI" that indicate AI-focused content
4. **Secondary Keywords**: Requires multiple secondary AI keywords to qualify
5. **Special Cases**: Handles edge cases like AI mentioned only in parentheses or legal/privacy news

## Files Changed

- `src/ai_content_filter.py` - Complete rewrite of the filtering logic

## Testing

A test file has been created at `tests/test_ai_filter_improvements.py` that validates the filter correctly excludes the problematic articles while still including legitimate AI news.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add src/ai_content_filter.py
   git commit -m "fix: improve AI content filter to reduce false positives"
   ```

2. **Deploy to Google Cloud**:
   ```bash
   # Use your existing deployment script
   ./scripts/deploy_production.sh
   # OR
   gcloud functions deploy slack-ai-news-digest \
     --runtime python311 \
     --trigger-topic slack-ai-news-trigger \
     --entry-point main_function_digest \
     --memory 512MB \
     --timeout 540s
   ```

3. **Test the deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Trigger a test run
   ./scripts/trigger_test.sh
   ```

## Verification

After deployment, monitor the next scheduled run to ensure:
- Non-AI articles (Nintendo, walking pads, legal news) are filtered out
- Legitimate AI news continues to appear
- The feed quality is improved

## Rollback

If issues occur, you can rollback:
```bash
git revert HEAD
./scripts/deploy_production.sh
```
